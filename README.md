# its just palera1n but with some custom installer features
# dont use this
all i did was add a --skipfakefs option to skip creating the fakefs and just mount it
DO NOT USE THIS TO AVOID CREATING FAKEFS
this is only for if you already have the fakefs and are too lazy to delete it cuz u screwd smth up and need to re jb or smth
